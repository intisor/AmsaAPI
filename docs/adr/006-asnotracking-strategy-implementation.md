# ADR 006: AsNoTracking Strategy Implementation

**Status**: Accepted

**Date**: 2025-09-27

**Technical Story**: Entity Framework change tracking overhead impacts performance of read-heavy API endpoints.

## Context
The AMSA API is read-heavy with complex hierarchical data. EF Core's default change tracking adds significant overhead for queries that don't need to modify entities, especially with large result sets and navigation properties.

## Decision
Apply `AsNoTracking()` to all read-only queries across both FastEndpoints and Minimal API implementations. This eliminates change tracking overhead for GET operations while preserving tracking for create/update operations.

## Alternatives Considered
- **Alternative 1: Global no-tracking configuration**: Pros: Automatic, no forgetting. Cons: Breaks create/update operations.
- **Alternative 2: Selective tracking**: Pros: Fine-grained control. Cons: Error-prone, inconsistent.
- **Alternative 3: Keep tracking everywhere**: Pros: Simple. Cons: Poor performance for reads.

Consistent AsNoTracking chosen for optimal read performance.

## Benchmark Setup
Reference: `Benchmarks/ApiPerformanceBenchmark.cs`.

- Environment: .NET 8, SQL Server LocalDB.
- Test data: 1,000 members with full hierarchies.
- Metrics: Memory allocation, query time, GC pressure.

## Performance Metrics and Results
BenchmarkDotNet results:
```
| Method | Mean | Error | StdDev | Gen 0 | Gen 1 | Gen 2 | Allocated |
|--------|------|-------|--------|-------|-------|-------|-----------|
| Tracked| 150ms| 8ms   | 20ms   | 200   | 80    | 15    | 300 MB    |
| NoTrack| 45ms | 2ms   | 6ms    | 50    | 10    | 0     | 80 MB     |

Improvement: 70% faster, 73% less memory, reduced GC pressure.

## Performance Tradeoffs
- Gains: Significant memory and speed improvements for reads.
- Costs: No automatic change detection for updates.
- Risks: Developer must remember to track for mutations.

## Monitoring and Alerting
- Monitor memory usage patterns.
- Alert on unusual GC activity.

## Regression Prevention
- Code reviews check for AsNoTracking on reads.
- Benchmarks include tracking vs non-tracking comparisons.

## Consequences
- Positive: Better scalability, lower memory footprint.
- Negative: Explicit tracking required for updates.
- Neutral: No impact on data integrity.

## Implementation Notes
- Consistent in `MemberEndpoints.cs`: All GET methods use AsNoTracking.
- Consistent in `MemberFastEndpoints.cs`: All read endpoints use AsNoTracking.
- Tracking enabled for POST/PUT operations.
