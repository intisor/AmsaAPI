# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

## Purpose and Benefits
Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) provide a lightweight way to document significant architectural decisions, their rationale, alternatives considered, and tradeoffs. They help teams understand why certain decisions were made, maintain institutional knowledge, and facilitate discussions about changes.

Benefits:
- **Clarity**: Clear documentation of decisions and their context.
- **Traceability**: Easy to track evolution of architecture over time.
- **Collaboration**: Structured format for team reviews and discussions.
- **Onboarding**: New team members can quickly understand key decisions.

## How to Create New ADRs
Use the CLI tools in `/docs/adr/tools/` to generate new ADRs:

1. Run `new-adr.ps1` from the tools directory.
2. Provide a title and select the type (standard, performance, security).
3. The script will create the ADR file, populate the template, update the index, and open it in your editor.
4. Fill out the content following the template guidelines.
5. Submit for team review.

## ADR Lifecycle and Status Management
ADRs go through the following statuses:
- **Proposed**: Initial draft, under discussion.
- **Accepted**: Decision approved and implemented.
- **Deprecated**: Decision no longer recommended but kept for historical reference.
- **Superseded**: Replaced by a newer ADR.

Use `adr-status.ps1` to update statuses and `update-index.ps1` to refresh the index.

## Integration with Performance Benchmarks
For performance-related ADRs, use the `performance-adr-template.md` and integrate with the existing BenchmarkDotNet setup:
- Run benchmarks using `BenchmarkRunner.cs`.
- Include results and links to reports in the ADR.
- Discuss tradeoffs and monitoring strategies.

## Key ADRs
See [adr-index.md](adr-index.md) for a complete list, organized by category:

- **Architecture**: Core system design decisions.
- **Performance**: Optimization choices with benchmarks.
- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, and data protection.
- **Database**: Schema, queries, and migration strategies.
- **API Design**: Endpoint structure, versioning, and contracts.

## Guidelines
Follow the process in [ADR-PROCESS.md](ADR-PROCESS.md) for when and how to create ADRs. Examples are in the `/examples/` directory.
