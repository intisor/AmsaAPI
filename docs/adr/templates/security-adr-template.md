# ADR [NUMBER]: [TITLE] - Security Decision

**Status**: Proposed

**Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]

**Technical Story**: Describe the security concern or requirement.

## Security Context
What security issue are we addressing? E.g., "Prevent SQL injection in member import endpoints."

## Threat Model
Identify potential threats:
- Unauthorized access to member data.
- Injection attacks via CSV imports.
- Data exposure in API responses.

## Security Requirements
- Parameterize all SQL queries.
- Implement role-based access control.
- Encrypt sensitive fields like Mkanid.

## Alternatives Considered
- **Alternative 1**: Client-side validation only – insufficient.
- **Alternative 2**: Third-party security library – adds dependencies.
- etc.

## Security Implications
- Reduces attack surface for EXCO member data.
- Ensures compliance with data protection standards.

## Compliance Considerations
- GDPR/POPIA for personal data.
- OWASP Top 10 guidelines.

## Security Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for input validation.
- Security scans with tools like SonarQube.
- Penetration testing for auth endpoints.

## Security Monitoring
- Log all access to sensitive endpoints.
- Alert on suspicious patterns (e.g., bulk imports).

## Consequences
- Positive: Enhanced data security.
- Negative: Additional validation overhead.
- Neutral: Minimal impact on performance.

## Implementation Notes
- Add FluentValidation to ImportEndpoints.cs.
- Configure JWT auth in Program.cs.
